really cool ray tracing thingy using webgpu

warning: very very laggy unless you have a good computer

you should check out the [credits](https://github.com/AlaTomKing/online-ray-tracing/blob/main/credits.md) because uhh they are the reason i can do this

### controls
- press <kbd>R</kbd> to render and start runnin!!!
- click on the canvas to move. press <kbd>esc</kbd> to exit out of it
- press <kbd>W</kbd>, <kbd>A</kbd>, <kbd>S</kbd>, <kbd>D</kbd> to move around. you can also press <kbd>Q</kbd>, <kbd>E</kbd> to uhh move vertically relative to your camera
- hold <kbd>⇧ Shift</kbd> to go slower or hold <kbd>␣ Space</kbd> to go faster
- move your mouse to move the camera
- to restart, just refresh

### where you should run this website

it is recommended to run on google chrome or like any chromium-based browser or safari as webgpu is kinda supported on there. firefox doesn't work from my experience.

but you can try firefox nightly, which is like a preview version showing new features and it is a bit buggy last i heard. webgpu works better there but i found a bug where holding shift makes the mouse movement freeze.
